# Todo:

8/8
* [X] Synced project with mongodb database
* [X] Dynamic api routes set up
* [X] /users and /users/:userId now work

For tomorrow, my goal is to entirely flesh out the rest of my api for this project. The end product will have routes for getting posts (which will have likes/reactions), uploading posts, getting all user profiles, and uploading and editing your own user profile. Since no front-end, I will have to test all routes via insomnia. Bit of a slow start to this project I admit, but this was my first real project in next.js and I am starting to get a feel for it now :p 

I will add in user authentication at a later point.
