# DALI Social Media Challenge

Submitted by: **Marvin Escobar Barajas**

I hope to create a working front-end and back-end for this project. I will
be using Next.js for this project, which does a lot of the heavy lifting on 
the backend portion, since it provides its own server and a working api 
through its filesystem.
