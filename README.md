# DALI Social Media Challenge

Submitted by: **Marvin Escobar Barajas**

I hope to create a working front-end and back-end for this project. I will
be using Next.js for this project, which does a lot of the heavy lifting on 
the backend portion, since it provides its own server and a working api 
through its filesystem.

[Follow my progress here!](https://github.com/Marvinesc3/social-media-challenge-dali/blob/main/todo.md)

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed for the front-end:

* [X] Display user
* [ ] Post Creation
* [X] Likes/reactions
* [X] Must be run locally on machines with either npm or yarn

The following **required** functionality is completed for the back-end:

* [X] Create a REST API with at least GET/POST routes
* [X] Must be run locally on machines with either npm or yarn

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Improve UI/UX of app
* [ ] incorporate d3.js to add some data-viz for the anonymous data chunks

## Notes
I realized I was using both npm and yarn throughout the project. Although it didn't cause any issues now, I definitely want to use only one for other projects I make.
If I ever needed to make my own website where I collect user pictures,
I need to make sure they are all cropped to the same size.
